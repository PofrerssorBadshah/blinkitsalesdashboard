# 🛒 Blinkit Sales & Inventory Dashboard – Power BI


## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard was built using Power BI to analyze Blinkit's **sales performance**, **inventory turnover**, and **regional contribution** across Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities.  
The goal was to help business stakeholders make smarter decisions on **stock planning, revenue strategy, and location-specific operations**.
